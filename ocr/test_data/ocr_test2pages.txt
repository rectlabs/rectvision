Named Entity Recognition (NER)

NER is the process of identifying and classifying named entities. So, the accuracy of a NER model is
dependent of the number of entities identifies and accuracy of the tags.

In NLP, two major go-to options for NER are spaCy and NLTK. One could also adopt some of the
transformer-based models on HuggingFace for named entity recognition.

SPACY

SpaCy is an open-source NLP library that has a number of pipelines with different model
components across major languages like English. These components are for:

- Token2vec

- Part of Speech Tagging

- Dependency Parser

- Attribute ruler

- Lemmatizer

- Named Entity Recognition.

While implementing any of the pipelines, one can also select which component they want to
perform with. For example, NER.

SpaCy pipeline variants for English can be found here. They were all trained on texts gotten from the
web like news, blogs, etc. en_core_web_sm has the smallest size of 12MB unlike en_core_web_trf,
which has a size of 438MB. The trade-off between the both is that the former is most efficient, while

the latter is most accurate.

The pipelines are trained on CNNs, except for en_core_web_trf which was combined with
HuggingFace transformer for better accuracy.

SpaCy models were trained using the Thinc Model, which is a wrapper for PyTorch, TensorFlow and
MXNET. In this case, the wrapper was used on PyTorch to run the CNN architectures.

The entities available in spaCy are 18 in number: 'CARDINAL'’, 'DATE', 'EVENT', 'FAC', 'GPE',
"LANGUAGE, 'LAW', 'LOC', 'MONEY', 'NORP'’, 'ORDINAL', 'ORG', 'PERCENT', 'PERSON', 'PRODUCT',
‘QUANTITY’, 'TIME', 'WORK_OF_ART'.

NLTK

There is no much public information on the model behind NLTK NER. However, NLTK also has a
wrapper for the StanfordNER that was built on Java [source] but is said to be computationally
expensive. The tags available could be between 3 to 7 depending on choice and they are locations,
persons, organizations, times, money, percents, and dates.

"WASHINGTON -- In the wake of a string of abuses by New York police officers in the 1990s, Loretta
E. Lynch, the top federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, spoke forcefully about the pain of a broken trust
that African-Americans felt and said the responsibility for repairing generations of
miscommunication and mistrust fell to law enforcement.",

"Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the killing of one of two Catholic
priests by kidnappers in the northern state of Kaduna.",

'He said the armed groups behind the spate of kidnappings of Christian clerics "seem to be
bent on creating chaos and disorder in the country",

"Emmanuel Onuarah, the president of the Premium Bread Makers Association, told the BBC
that some bakeries had had to fire their staff as they were not able to pay salaries.",

"He suggested that the government should stop charging a 15% tax on imported wheat - the
price of which has already shot up this year because of the war in Ukraine.",

"The youths had attended a wedding in Imo state and were on their way home when they

were shot, Amnesty said.",

"The famous Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has thrown her support behind the
Labour Party's presidential candidate, Peter Obi, ahead of the country's February 2023 elections.",

"He was dubbed Super Mario for his handling of the eurozone crisis as head of the European
Central Bank. In February last year, he was given the task of guiding Italy through the Covid
pandemic and economic recovery, bolstered by a big EU package conditional on major reforms."
