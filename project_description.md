# RectVision

##  Welcome to the RectVision Package!
**[RectVision](https://rectvision.com/)** is a web-based tool that helps you organize your AI data process, end to end on a single platform. It allows users to create training reproducible pipelines or workflow from data annotation to model training, deployment and inferencing.

This package allows registered RectVision users to interact with the web-based platform via simple python commands from a local machine or on Google Colab. It is built to work seamlessly with the features of the [RectVision webapp](https://app.rectvision.com/auth/sign-in?returnTo=%252Fd), allowing users to 

- download and convert annotations made in the webapp
- modify or process images and data
- train and evaluate models
- perform inference with trained models
